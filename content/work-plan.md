## Work Plan
{:#work-plan}

Before the workshop, we plan on preparing an extension of SolidBench so it can simulate heterogeneous interfaces.
Furthermore, we will prepare an architecture for implementing various techniques into the Comunica framework for solving the problem.
During the workshop, we will attempt to implement prototypes for
1) the discovery of heterogeneous interfaces during link traversal, and
2) adaptively incorporating them into the query plan.
Afterwards, we will evaluate their performance in terms of various metrics using SolidBench.
