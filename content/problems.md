## Problems
{:#problems}

Initiatives such as [Solid](cite:cites solid) aim to solve problems
surrounding personal data exploitation by decentralizing data on the Web.
Solid does this by allowing everyone to own a personal *data pod*,
in which any kind of data can be stored which is in full control of the user.
It is up to the user to choose who and what can access which data.
Currently, these pods expose RDF and non-RDF data through the document-oriented [Linked Data Platform](cite:cites spec:ldp) interface.
While it has been shown that such interfaces can be queried over [using link traversal-based approaches](cite:cites solidquery),
there is interest in [exposing alternative interfaces](cite:cites whatsinapod) that may lead to more efficient query execution,
such as the various [Linked Data Fragments interfaces](cite:cites ldf).
