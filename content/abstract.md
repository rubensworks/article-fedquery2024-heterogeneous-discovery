## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Decentralized environments such as Solid are identified by permissioned document-oriented interfaces
which enable personal data to be stored in so-called *data pods*.
Such document-oriented interfaces can lead to limitations in terms of query performance,
which may necessitate the existence of more expressive interfaces in such environments.
However, these interfaces may be heterogeneous in their nature due to different requirements and hardware capabilities for different pods.
<!-- Need         -->
Given the existence of this heterogeneity in server interfaces across decentralized environments,
there is a need for techniques to discover them, and make use of them during query execution.
<!-- Task         -->
As such, we propose a technique based on link traversal to discover heterogeneous interfaces at query time,
which can be incorporated adaptively into the query plan.
<!-- Object       -->
Concretely, we propose the development of a prototype that can discover such interfaces and incorporate them into a federated query engine.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
<!-- Perspectives -->
This prototype might yield relevant research opportunities for future work in the domain of federated query processing.
